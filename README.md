## XMSS reference code [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/XMSS/xmss-reference.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/XMSS/xmss-reference)

Fork of the XMSS reference code such that I can use binsec-rel on it. The file that makes the XMSS signature and that binsec_rel will be using is `xmss_binsec_rel.c`.

> This repository contains the reference implementation that accompanies [RFC 8391: _"XMSS: eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme"_](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391).

> This reference implementation supports all parameter sets as defined in the RFC at run-time (specified by prefixing the public and private keys with a 32-bit `oid`). Implementations that want to use compile-time parameter sets can remove the `struct xmss_params` function parameter, and globally replace the use of its attributes by compile-time constants.

> Please note that this reference implementation is **intended for cross-validation and experimenting**. Deploying cryptographic code in practice requires careful consideration of the specific deployment scenario and relevant threat model. This holds perhaps doubly so for stateful signature schemes such as XMSS.

> _When using the current code base, please be careful, expect changes and watch this document for further documentation. In particular, `xmss_core_fast.c` is long due for a serious clean-up. While this will not change its public API or output, it may affect the storage format of the BDS state (i.e. part of the secret key)._

### Building

To build `xmss_binsec_rel.c`, simply run `make xmss_binsec`. You can also just build everything by running `make`, but this is not needed and skips over tests as it was giving me a weird bug.

### Dependencies

For the SHA-2 hash functions (i.e. SHA-256 and SHA-512), we rely on OpenSSL. Make sure to install the OpenSSL development headers. On Debian-based systems, this is achieved by installing the OpenSSL development package `libssl-dev`.

On Arch Linux, I do not think that a precompiled libcrypto.a file is available, so I built openssl with the `-m32` and `-static` flags and included the necessary files in this repo (see folder `openssl32`)

### License

This reference implementation was written by Andreas HÃ¼lsing and Joost Rijneveld. All included code is available under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.

Binsec-rel inclusion by me :)
